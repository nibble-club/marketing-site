# Nibble Marketing Page
Nibble is a marketplace for food that is too fresh to be kept overnight.  Restaurants throw away 22-33 billion lbs of food every year in the U.S., spending an estimated $162 billion every year in costs related to wasted food. Much of it is completely fresh, too fresh in fact to be served the next day.

Nibble helps provide easy, inexpensive meals for customers by helping restaurants sell this food instead of throwing it away.
